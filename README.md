# Uncertainties in large-scale precipitation data sets during five recent European extreme events

This repository evaluates uncertainties among large-scale precipitation datasets during extreme precipitation events.

## Repository Structure

* Example_Workflow.ipynb: shows the analysis process for a single extreme event, including statistical metric calculations and Taylor diagram generation.
* Final.ipynb: Provides the analysis across all events, generating final summary plots and comprehensive statistics.
